# Age 18+ Credential Specification

This repository defines the structure, semantics, and usage of the **Age 18+ Credential** (`AgeOver18Credential`), issued by [18plus.app](https://18plus.app). It enables privacy-preserving, verifiable age checks in compliance with the EU Digital Identity (EUDI) framework and the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard.

**18+ App** acts as an intermediate wallet provider, issuing age credentials on demand to third-party relying parties based on age assurance provided by a PiD Provider.


---

## üßæ Overview

**AgeOver18Credential** is a digital credential asserting that the subject is over 18 years old. It is:

- **Minimally disclosive** (no birthdate, no exact age)
- **Machine-verifiable** (signed JWT format)
- **EU compliant** (based on MDAV and EUDI Wallet specifications)
- **Extensible** (adds transparent metadata like method and assurance)
- **Double-blind by design** (issuer and verifier never learn each other‚Äôs or the user‚Äôs identity)

## üß© Position in EUDI Wallet Architecture

The **AgeOver18Credential** aligns with the **EUDI Wallet ARF** roles:

- **PID Provider** = PID Provider (performs identity verification and issues age evidence)
- **18plus.app** = Intermediate Wallet Provider (holds evidence, issues AgeOver18Credential)
- **Relying Party** = Service provider verifying credentials presented via user wallet

This model ensures **privacy**, **provenance**, and **compliance** with EU ARF architecture requirements.

## üìö Field Breakdown

### Top-level JWT fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `iss` | DID of the credential issuer. 18plus.app uses `did:web:18plus.app`. |
| `sub` | DID of the credential subject (typically a wallet-held DID like `did:key`). |
| `nbf` | Unix timestamp for when the credential becomes valid (Not Before). |
| `exp` | Unix timestamp for expiration of the credential. |
| `jti` | A unique identifier for the JWT credential (UUID). |

### `vc` object (Verifiable Credential)

The `vc` object follows the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) and includes standard and custom context extensions.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `@context` | List of JSON-LD contexts used to define terms in the credential. Includes W3C, EU, and 18plus extensions. |
| `type` | Always includes `"VerifiableCredential"` and `"AgeOver18Credential"`. |
| `credentialSubject` | Contains the actual subject claims, including the age assertion and extended metadata (see below). |

### üîç `credentialSubject` Fields

| Field                  | Type               | Required | Description |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| `id`                   | string             | ‚úî        | DID of the subject (e.g. `did:key:...`) |
| `type`                 | string             | ‚úî        | Always `"Person"` |
| `isOver18`             | boolean            | ‚úî        | Always `true`. This is the core assertion. |
| `pidProvider`          | string (DID)       |          | The PID Provider who performed the original verification. Omitted when regulatory frameworks (e.g. France‚Äôs ARCOM) prohibit issuer identification by relying parties. |
| `verificationMethod`   | string             |          | The method used to perform the verification (`passport`, `eID`, `face_scan`, `credit_card`, etc.) |
| `loa`                  | string             |          | Level of Assurance, in line with the eIDAS Regulation (`LoA1`, `LoA2`, or `LoA3`) |
| `session`              | string (UUID/nonce)|          | Session identifier for replay protection or binding issuance to an authentication flow |

## üì¶ Custom JSON-LD Context

The `AgeOver18Credential` provides additional fields. These enable transparency of the underlying age credential supporting to the **Relying Party** to support regulatory compliance in certain jurisdictions.

- **`pidProvider`** ‚Äî The DID of the original PID Provider that verified the user‚Äôs age. *Optional.* Omitted where regulatory frameworks (e.g. France‚Äôs ARCOM) prohibit.

- **`verificationMethod`** ‚Äî A string describing the method of verification (e.g. `passport`, `eID`, `face_scan`, `credit_card`). *Optional.* 

- **`loa`** ‚Äî The Level of Assurance (`LoA1`, `LoA2`, `LoA3`), aligned with [eIDAS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014R0910) standards. *Optional.* 

- **`session`** ‚Äî An ephemeral UUID or nonce generated by the gateway (either the issuer‚Äôs or the verifier‚Äôs). Used for replay protection and session binding. It is opaque and unlinkable across credentials.  *Optional.* 




```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@version": 1.1,
    "pidProvider": {
      "@id": "https://18plus.app/credentials/schema/pidProvider",
      "@type": "@id"
    },
    "verificationMethod": {
      "@id": "https://18plus.app/credentials/schema/verificationMethod",
      "@type": "https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    },
    "loa": {
      "@id": "https://18plus.app/credentials/schema/loa",
      "@type": "https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    },
    "session": {
      "@id": "https://18plus.app/credentials/schema/session",
      "@type": "https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    }
  }
}
```

This context defines additional fields needed to interpret metadata provided by 18plus.app while remaining fully interoperable with the EU‚Äôs context.

## üìöMotivation

This credential format is built for real-world, legally sensitive scenarios such as:
- Adult content access (pornography, gambling)
- Alcohol or tobacco purchase
- KYC-lite user onboarding
- Compliance with eIDAS 2.0, EUDI Wallet, and MDAV

It ensures:
- Minimal disclosure of data
- Strong cryptographic verifiability
- Transparent provenance and method tracking
- Assurance-level signaling for relying parties

---

## üîê Verification & Trust

- The credential is signed using `ES256` and can be verified using the public key listed in [https://18plus.app/.well-known/did.json](https://18plus.app/.well-known/did.json)

- The proof key is:

```json
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:18plus.app#key-1"
```

- Verifiers can resolve the did:web:18plus.app DID and validate the JWS signature from the JWT.

---

## üß™ Example Usage

### Minimal Disclosure

```json
{
  "isOver18": true
}
```

### Full Disclosure (Optional Metadata)

```json
{
  "isOver18": true,
  "pidProvider": "did:web:verifier.example",
  "verificationMethod": "passport",
  "loa": "LoA3"
}
```

## ‚úÖ Level of Assurance

LoA refers to how strongly a credential is backed by identity verification and fraud resistance. Under the eIDAS Regulation, there are three core levels:
- `LoA1` (Low): Weak identity proofing, possibly self-registration
- `LoA2` (Substantial): Stronger identity checks and multi-factor authentication
- `LoA3` (High): Credential issued based on strong evidence (e.g. passport) and secure proofing methods  Ôøº

These are widely used across European national eID schemes to indicate the trust level of issued credentials  Ôøº

### üá´üá∑ French Double Anonymity Requirement

French regulator **ARCOM** requires age verification systems to support **double anonymity** ‚Äî a strict separation ensuring:


1. The **service provider** (e.g. adult website) must not learn the **user's** identity
2. The **service provider** must not learn the identity of the **PID Provider** (who performed age verification)
3. The **PID Provider** must not learn which services the **user** accesses
4. No party should be able to correlate multiple verifications back to the same user

Your **AgeOver18Credential** implementation is *double‚Äëblind by design*:
- The **issuer (18plus.app)** never learns which site the user visits
- The **verifier site** only sees the assertion (`isOver18‚Ää:¬†true`), not the user's identity or SID
- Provenance metadata (`pidProvider`, `verificationMethod`, `loa`, `session`) is self-contained and unlinkable
